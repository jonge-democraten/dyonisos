About
=====
Dyonisos is a Django based web application that was developed for the
Jonge Democraten. The JD organized events with some regularity where
guests have to subscribe and sometimes pay for entry. This is what
Dyonisos was made for. It should be easy to create a form for an event,
easy for guests to subscribe and pay and easy for the organizers of the
event to see who is subscribed to what.

Installation
============
Most dependencies are handled by pip and `requirements.txt`.

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    
You will need a Mollie.nl account to handle payments.
